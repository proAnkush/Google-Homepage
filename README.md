# Google-Homepage
This repository is meant to be used for submitting under the odin project's, (Foundations) Project I where the learner is supposed to create a Google homepage in plain HTML/CSS without referring to the devkit, or someone else's code. 

After creating this, I am able to create Navigation Bars, Footers, and some different basic html elements. This also helped me getting familiar with the css grid and flex, which seems easy until not practically implemented, DUH. 

Also, it helped me to get familiar with the Git(local) and Github workflow, along with Linux CLI.

Helpful?
